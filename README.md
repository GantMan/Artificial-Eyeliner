# Artificial-Eyeliner
A script to artificially apply eyeliner on live video (Webcam videos and images also supported)

 ## Project Structure:
 
 ### Flow Chart:
<img src="https://github.com/kaushil24/Artificial-Eyeliner/blob/master/Media/working.jpg" height="1000">

### Project Explaination:
* We first locate the faces present in an image. 
* On each face detected, we locate 68 facial landmark points.
* We extract the points representing eyes (pt no. 37-49) out of those 68 points.
* We interpolate over the extracted eye landmark points to generate a curve. 
* We draw over this curve and we have our eyeliner.

### Code Overview:
* ```lndMrkDetector()``` : To extract 68 facial landmark points
* ```getEyeLandmarkPts()``` : To extract eye landmark points (pt no 37-48)
* ```getEyelinerPoints()``` : To interpolate those eye landmark points
* ```drawEyeliner()```: To draw eyeliner on interpolated points

 ## Getting Started:
 ### Clone the repo using:<br>
 ```git clone https://github.com/kaushil24/Artificial-Eyeliner/```
 
 ### Starting virtual environment:
 * Install the ```venv``` module:<br>
 ```python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv```
 * Setup the virtual environment and activate it:<br>
 ```python3 -m venv env``` <br>
 ```source env/bin/activate```
  
 ### Installing the dependencies:
 * To install **Dlib** please visit this article-https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/03/27/how-to-install-dlib/
 * Rest of the dependencies:
 ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
 
 ### Sample Test:
 ```python3 eyeliner.py -v "Media/Sample Video.mp4" -s "Output"```

 ## CLI Usage
 ```python eyeliner.py [-i image] [-v video] [-d dat] [-t thickness] [-c color] [-s save]```
 * ```-i ```: Location of image you want to apply eyeliner on
 * ```-v ```: Location of video you want to apply eyeliner on.
 * ```-v ```: Live eyeliner of webcam video if ```webcam``` is given (Eg: ```python3 -v webcam -s "webcam"```)
 * ```-t ```: Whole interger number to set thickness of eyeliner. Default = ```2```. Recommended number value between 0-5
 * ```-d```: Path to your ```shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat``` file. Default value is the root unless you have the ```shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat``` file stored at some other location you need not use this argument.
 * ```-c ```: Change color of the eyeliner. Use ```-c 255 255 255```. Defaule = ```0 0 0```.
 * ```-s ```: Location and file name you want to save the output to. **NOTE** The program automatically adds extension while saving the file. **NOTE**: If a file with same name already exists, it will overwrite that file.

## To Do:
- [ ] Analyze the results on different eye shapes and color.
- [ ] Dynamically change eyeliner thickness based on the distance between subject and camera.
- [ ] Add support for people wearing spectacles.
